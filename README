# sisCLI

sisCLI offers command line functionality to access osiris.ru.nl for Radboud students. 
It is shipped with a Python class that serves as an API and that can easily be adapted to other projects and a wrapper around it that serves as the command line interface.

To use it, first sign in using
```
python sis.py sign-in
```
the client will then ask for your credentials and will store an access token at `~/.osiris_token` so you don't need to sign in every time.
Then, you can use any of the commands like this:
```
python sis.py <command_name>
```
Some commands have optional parameters. To read more about a command, use
```
python sis.py <command_name> --help
```
Finally, for maximum convenience add
```
alias sis="python REPO_PATH/sis.py"
```
to your `.bashrc`. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me or add an issue.
